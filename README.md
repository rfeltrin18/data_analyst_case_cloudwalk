# Paraná IRS dataset analysis

Our objective is providing insight on a Receita Federal (Brazilian equivalent to the IRS from United States)  dataset of companies from Paraná, one of the richest Brazilian states.

It is divided in two parts:

## Part I: ETL

Loading and data wrangling such as fixing columns with unusable formatting and creating new ones that might be useful.

## Part II: EDA

Descriptive stats and data visualisation to generate business insights for a software company.
